Mutils is a static library, consisting of classes, aliases, functions and types created to simplify your routine of writing code. It's Boost, but etremely small.

Mutils tries to be small and simple. In fact, its code is so simple that you can understand its source code without effort. Documentation is present as well.

Not tested. Not planned on being tested, neither. You can try, though.

> Q: What do I do if I encounter a bug?

If you encounter a bug, please open an issue explaining it. PRs are welcome as well.

> Q: What does the name stand for?

Mutils (pronounced as `muËˆti:ls`) is a short-hand alias for **M**izo**Utils**. And Mizo is one of my nicknames.

> Q: What are the empty `//` comments in the code?

I use the empty comments to prevent clang-format from formatting certain things as a one-liner, which sometimes is unwanted and infuriating.

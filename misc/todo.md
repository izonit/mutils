## TODO for mutils
**A list with plans and ideas regarding mutils**

- `!!!` Improve the documentation overall (and, preferrably, add docs to the source files as well).
- Switch to mutils-logger in the File Handler. Use mutils-logger for logging. Might require refactoring.
- Integrate GTest to catch bugs automatically.
